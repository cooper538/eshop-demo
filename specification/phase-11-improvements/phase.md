# Phase 11: Improvements & Refactoring

## Metadata
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Status | 🔵 in_progress |

## Objective
Address technical debt, improve DDD alignment, and validate system reliability through E2E testing.

## Scope
- [x] Separate Product catalog from Stock inventory (distinct aggregates)
- [x] Architecture tests for Clean Architecture and DDD compliance
- [x] UnitOfWork behavior refactoring (domain events before SaveChanges)
- [x] IDateTimeProvider abstraction for testability
- [x] Analytics Service (pub-sub pattern demonstration)
- [ ] E2E happy flow validation (Order flows, Stock Low Alert, CorrelationId)
- [ ] E2E error flow validation (404, 400, service unavailable)

## Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Dependencies |

| 01 | [Product Domain Refactoring](tasks/task-01-product-domain-refactoring.md) | ✅ | - |
| 02 | [Architecture Tests](tasks/task-02-architecture-tests.md) | ✅ | - |
| 03 | [UnitOfWork Behavior](tasks/task-03-unitofwork-behavior.md) | ✅ | - |
| 04 | [IDateTimeProvider](tasks/task-04-datetime-provider.md) | ✅ | - |
| 05 | [Analytics Service](tasks/task-05-analytics-service.md) | ✅ | - |
| 06 | [E2E Happy Flow Validation](tasks/task-06-e2e-happy-flow-validation.md) | ⚪ | 05 |
| 07 | [E2E Error Flow Validation](tasks/task-07-e2e-error-flow-validation.md) | ⚪ | 06 |

## Goals

- Address technical debt and design issues discovered during implementation
- Improve DDD alignment with proper aggregate boundaries and bounded context separation
- Prepare domain model for future scalability (Inventory as separate microservice)
- Complete E2E validation to ensure system reliability

## Notes

- Tasks 01-05 are completed implementation improvements
- Tasks 06-07 are validation tasks (non-development) using `/e2e-test` skill
- E2E test tooling is ready in `tools/e2e-test/`
