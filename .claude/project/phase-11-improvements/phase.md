# Phase 11: Improvements & Refactoring

## Status
- [ ] In progress

## Overview

This phase contains improvements, refactoring, and technical debt fixes that emerged during development.
These are enhancements that improve code quality, domain model alignment, or architectural patterns.

## Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 01 | [Product Domain Refactoring](tasks/task-01-product-domain-refactoring.md) | Separate Product catalog from Stock inventory into distinct aggregates | Completed |
| 02 | [Architecture Tests](tasks/task-02-architecture-tests.md) | NetArchTest.Rules tests for Clean Architecture and DDD compliance | Not started |

## Goals

- Address technical debt and design issues discovered during implementation
- Improve DDD alignment with proper aggregate boundaries and bounded context separation
- Prepare domain model for future scalability (Inventory as separate microservice)

## Notes

- Tasks in this phase are optional but recommended for production readiness
- New improvements can be added as development progresses
